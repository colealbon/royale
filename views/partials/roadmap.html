        <li>Alice and Bob agree on a certain "<a href="#/deck">deck</a>" of cards. In practice, this means they agree on a set of numbers or other data such that each element of the set represents a card.</li>
        <li>Alice picks an encryption key A and uses this to encrypt each card of the deck.</li>
        <li>Alice <a href="https://bost.ocks.org/mike/shuffle/">shuffles</a> the cards.</li>
        <li>Alice passes the encrypted and shuffled deck to Bob. With the encryption in place, Bob cannot know which card is which.</li>
        <li>Bob shuffles the deck.</li>
        <li>Bob passes the double encrypted and shuffled deck back to Alice.</li>
        <li>Alice decrypts each card using her key A. This still leaves Bob's encryption in place though so she cannot know which card is which.</li>
        <li>Alice picks one encryption key for each card (A1, A2, etc.) and encrypts them individually.</li>
        <li>Alice passes the deck to Bob.</li>
        <li>Bob decrypts each card using his key B. This still leaves Alice's individual encryption in place though so he cannot know which card is which.</li>
        <li>Bob picks one encryption key for each card (B1, B2, etc.) and encrypts them individually.</li>
        <li>Bob passes the deck back to Alice.</li>
        <li>Alice publishes the deck for everyone playing (in this case only Alice and Bob, see below on expansion though).</li>
